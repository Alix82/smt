Migration between SCC and NCC
=============================

SMT can talk to only one registration service (SCC, NCC, alternatively also SLMS). The switch between the registration servers can be done either via YaST module or via command-line tools.

Before performing the switch between customer cetners, make sure that the target customer cetner serves all products that are registered against SMT. Both YaST the command-line tools perform check to find out whether all products can be served with the new registration server. It it is not possible, the only option is to install parallel SMT and to synchronize products from both SCC and NCC.

To perform the migration to SCC via command-line, run:

  smt ncc-scc-migration

tool. To get its parameter, use the --help option. If you need to revert back from SCC to NCC, use

  smt scc-ncc-migration

The migration itself is time-sonsuming and during the migration process the SMT server may not be able to serve clients, which are already registered.

The migration process itself changes the registration server and the proper type of API in the configuraiton files. There is no other task needed from user to perform the switch.

To migrate between NCC and SCC via YaST, use the YaST smt-server module

After migration, it is needed to re-synchronize the repositories.



Repository structure
====================

The repository structure in the /srv/www/htdocs directory matches the structure as it comes from SCC. This directory structure differs from the structure coming from NCC. There are following directories in the structure (selected examples, similar for other products and architectures):

repo/SUSE/Products/SLE-SDK/12/x86_64/product/

- the -POOL repository of SDK (the GA version of all packages)

repo/SUSE/Products/SLE-SDK/12/x86_64/product.license/

- EULA associated with the product

repo/SUSE/Updates/SLE-SDK/12/x86_64/update/
repo/SUSE/Updates/SLE-SDK/12/s390x/update/
repo/SUSE/Updates/SLE-SERVER/12/x86_64/update/

- Update repositories for respective products

repo/full/SUSE/Updates/SLE-SERVER/12/x86_64/update/
repo/testing/SUSE/Updates/SLE-SERVER/12/x86_64/update/

- Repositories optionally created for staging of respecive repositories. The semantics is the same as with repositories from NCC


Enabling SLP announcements
==========================

SMT already includes the SLP service description file (/etc/slp.reg.d/smt.reg). In order to enable SLP announcements of the SMT service, open respective ports in firewall and enable the SLP service.

  sysconf_addword /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2 FW_SERVICES_EXT_TCP "427"
  sysconf_addword /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2 FW_SERVICES_EXT_UDP "427"
  insserv slpd
  rcslpd start
