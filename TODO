TODO :

Possible code improvements
=============================

- overwrite DBI module to log statements and results at a common place

- new DBI module could provide named queries
  (See SMT12 branch DB.pm module)

- SCC API version 1 and 2 was only used during Beta of SLES12.
  These files could be merged with version 3 to cleanup the code.

- try to improve progress status reporting on the commandline

- For new REST interface, provide common functions to create objects
  for products, repos, etc.

DONE:
=====

Rejected:
=========

- 2. e-mail address for admin mails.
  (e.g. smt-mirror --mail)
  Reason: we use one address for all.
